# Huffman String Compression
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. 

- This projects implements Huffman coding algorithm using min heap of C++ STL library.
